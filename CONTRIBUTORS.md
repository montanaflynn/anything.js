# Contributors

These people are amazing. Not true. They've just done what we told them: add whatever they wanted to add to anything.js. Nevertheless, they still contributed in making this library better (hopefully). Ordered alphabetically. Feel free to add yourself if you even added a tiny little function to anything.js!
